# Calculator Homework

## Objectives:
- Practice with functions, loops, conditions, user-input, switch/case

## Activity
- You will be building a calculator.  A calculator can perform multiple arithmetic operations.  Your function should allow the user to choose which operation is expected, enter in the values to perform the operation on, and ultimately view the result.

###Specification:
- A user should be given a menu of operations
- A user should be able to choose from the menu
- A user should be able to enter numbers to perform the operation on
- A user should be shown the result
- The program should exit after one calculation is made

#####Phase 1
- Calculator functionality
	- Calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic (+,-, *, /)

#####Phase 2
- Advanced Calculator functionality
	- Calculator should be able to do more advanced arithmetic (exponents, square, cube, square roots)

### BONUS STAGE - HARD MODE
- Calculator should have sine, cosine and tangent calculations. However, you should *not* use any built in trigonometric methods and you must create your own.
